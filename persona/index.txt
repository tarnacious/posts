I added the ability to sign into this site to comment with [Mozilla
Persona][persona]. Not that I'm expecting people to use it, I've only had a
handful of genuine comments since I started the site some years ago. I was just
interested in trying it out, which is why I have this site.

It was pretty straight forward as I already only support the concept of signing
in with 3rd party authentication providers such at OpenID, Google and Twitter.
Adding Persona was just adding another provider, I didn't need to change
how the authentication system works. Here is the [commit][commit].

A difference from the other providers is that I had to use Javascript. It's not
that I don't like Javascript, [many][j2] [posts][j3] [here][j4]
[have][j5] [running][j6] [Javascript][j7] [in][j8] [the][j9] [content][j10].
It's just over the several re-writes of this site in different languages I've
included less Javascript in the site itself. There was none on this site, I
liked it that way.

Another thing I liked is OpenID. I understand it had usability and adoption
issues. With OpenID though, I could choose who manages my identity or I could
[manage it myself][pythonopenid]. Apparently an email provider (in my case, me)
can implement the Persona (BrowswerID) protocol and not depend on
[login.persona.org][login_persona]. Perhaps that is something I will look into
after posting this.

Finally a note on adoption; I was having dinner with &Ouml;zlem last night and tried
to explain Persona, but was unable to convince her to even try it to sign into
this site. To be fair it's only a sample size of one and I think &Ouml;zlem was
hoping dinner conversation wouldn't be about online identity management.
