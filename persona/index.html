<p>I added the ability to sign into this site with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/">Mozilla Persona</a> to
comment. Not that I'm expecting people to use it, I've only had a handful of
genuine comments since I started the site some years ago. I was just interested
in trying it out, which is why I have this site. </p>

<p>It was pretty staight forward as I already only support the concept of signing
in with 3rd party authentication providers such at OpenID, Google and Twitter.
So adding Persona was just adding another provider, so I didn't need to change
how the authentication system works. Here is the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/tarnacious/author/commits/c71a9525fd22643371875316257704760e16063a">commit</a>.</p>

<p>The only thing that is different from the other providers is that I had to use
Javascript. It's not that I don't like Javascript, <a href="https://tarnbarford.net/journal/uhc-haskell-to-javascript">many</a> <a href="https://tarnbarford.net/journal/cube">of</a>
<a href="https://tarnbarford.net/journal/tile-land">posts</a> <a href="https://tarnbarford.net/journal/asteroids">here</a> <a href="https://tarnbarford.net/journal/transforms">have</a> <a href="https://tarnbarford.net/journal/old-school-for-fun">running</a> <a href="https://tarnbarford.net/journal/rxjs-zip">Javascript</a> <a href="https://tarnbarford.net/journal/rxjs-capture">in</a>
<a href="https://tarnbarford.net/journal/rxjs-merge">the</a> <a href="https://tarnbarford.net/journal/revisiting-dragging-and-inertia-with-rxjs">content</a>. It's just over the several re-writes of this site in
different languages I've included less Javascript in the site itself. There was
none on this site, I liked it that way.</p>

<p>Another thing I liked is OpenID. I understand it had usability and adoption
issues. With OpenID though, I could choose who manages my identity or I could
<a href="https://github.com/openid/python-openid">manage it myself</a>. Apparently my email provider (in my case, me)
can implement the Persona (BrowswerID) protocol and not depend on
login.persona.org to identify me. Perhaps that is somthing I will look into
after posting this. </p>

<p>Finally a note on adoption; I was having dinner with Ozlem last night and tried
to explain Persona, but was unable to convince her to even try it to sign into
this site. To be fair it's only a sample size of one and I think she was hoping
dinner conversation wasn't going to be about online identity management.  </p>
