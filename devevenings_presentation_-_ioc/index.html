Here are the slides and the mysterious code that was never shown from my <a href="http://www.deveve.net/">DevEvening</a> presentation. 
</p>
<p>
Appologies it&#39;s taken a while to get them up, I was hoping to write a bit of a post about what I covered and some of the discussion that came up. That never happened.

I think the presentation went well, the group was really good and we got some good discussions happening before being interrupted by delicious paramas of the world.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m looking forward to the next meeting, except it appears I&#39;ve signed up to represent NoSql (of which I currently know very little about) in an ORM smackdown. 
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s what happens when you have meetings at a pub. Anyway it should fun and I&#39;m looking forward to learning enough about NoSql to adequatly represent it in the smackdown.

<p>
See ya there.
