Here are the slides and the mysterious code that was never shown from my
[DevEvening][1] presentation.

Appologies it's taken a while to get them up, I was hoping to write a bit of a
post about what I covered and some of the discussion that came up. That never
happened.

I think the presentation went well, the group was really good and we got some
good discussions happening before being interrupted by delicious paramas of
the world.

I'm looking forward to the next meeting, except it appears I've signed up to
represent NoSql (of which I currently know very little about) in an ORM
smackdown.

That's what happens when you have meetings at a pub. Anyway it should fun and
I'm looking forward to learning enough about NoSql to adequatly represent it
in the smackdown.

See ya there.
