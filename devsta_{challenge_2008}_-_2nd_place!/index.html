<p>The winners for <a href="http://devsta.microsoft.com.au/">DevSta {Challenge 2008}</a> have been announced: <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/software/soa/GPS-Tag-wins-Microsoft-Devsta-Challenge/0,139023769,339292785-1s,00.htm">GPS Tag wins Microsoft Devsta Challenge</a>. My <a href="/post/2008/10/07/DevSta-7bChallenge-20087d.aspx">Desktop Racer</a> entry came 2nd. I'm naturally disappointed I didn't win, but definitely happy with 2nd. It was heaps of fun entering and I'm glad the stress is over ;-) </p> <p>Congratulations to all the entrants, particularly the winners <a href="http://jsarge.wordpress.com/">Jarred Sarge</a> and <a href="http://wolfbyte-net.blogspot.com/">Michael Minutillo</a> for their GPS Tag Game. Hopefully we'll compete again next year.&nbsp; Enjoy Vegas boys. </p>
