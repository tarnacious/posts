The winners for [DevSta {Challenge 2008}][1] have been announced: [GPS Tag
wins Microsoft Devsta Challenge][2]. My [Desktop Racer][3] entry came 2nd. I'm
naturally disappointed I didn't win, but definitely happy with 2nd. It was
heaps of fun entering and I'm glad the stress is over ;-)

Congratulations to all the entrants, particularly the winners [Jarred
Sarge][4] and [Michael Minutillo][5] for their GPS Tag Game. Hopefully we'll
compete again next year.  Enjoy Vegas boys.
