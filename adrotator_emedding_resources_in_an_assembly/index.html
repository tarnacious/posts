This article is part of a series of posts about various aspects of writing web controls for ASP.Net using an ad rotator as an example. The <a href="/post/2008/06/AdRotator-WebControl-Example.aspx">AdRotator WebControl Example</a> post has links to related posts and downloads.

The AdRotator has several scripts which it emits in the output. I wanted the AdRotator completely encapsulated in a single &quot;dll&quot; file. I choose to embed the scripts in the assembly and read them back at run time. I could have included the scripts in the code as a string but I feel having escaped script declarations in code is more difficult to read and maintain. It also makes it difficult for the IDE to provide intellisense.

Its easy to embed a file included in a project into the projects output assembly. The setting can be found by selecting properties of the file you want embed and selecting &quot;Embedded Resource&quot; as the &quot;Build Action&quot;.

The file can be read back as a stream by reflecting the assembly and getting the resource by name. Below is an example of reading a resource by name into a string.

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> GetResourceString(<span class="kwrd">string</span> resourceName)
{
Assembly assembly = GetType().Assembly;
<span class="kwrd">    string</span> resourceFullName = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">&quot;{0}.{1}&quot;</span>, assembly.GetName().Name, resourceName);
<span class="kwrd">    string</span> resourceString;
<span class="kwrd">    using</span> (Stream stream = assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(resourceFullName))
{
TextReader reader = <span class="kwrd">new</span> StreamReader(stream);
resourceString = reader.ReadToEnd();
reader.Close();
}
<span class="kwrd">    return</span> resourceString;
}

As far as the code above goes, if it was a more professional application the method would be protected by a unit tested wrapper with application specific exception handling.

There is a <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/#resourceE">free tool</a> created by the Sells Brothers you can use to view the resources embedded in an assembly that may be useful.
