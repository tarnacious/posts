This article is part of a series of posts about various aspects of writing web controls for ASP.Net using an ad rotator as an example. The <a href="/post/2008/06/AdRotator-WebControl-Example.aspx">AdRotator WebControl Example</a> post has links to related posts and downloads.

The AdRotator needs to insert a class definition script in the output once, even if multiple AdRotator controls are declared on the page. It also needs to insert a script that instantiates that class prototype for every AdRotator control on the page. Fortunately there are static methods on the System.Web.UI.Page object that will do this for us. 
</p>
<p>
Page.ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript(Type type, string key, string script)
</p>
<p>
The keys here a crucial, there is only one script rendered for each key. If we inject the definition script with a static key it means no matter how many instances control try to register it, only one instance of script will be sent to the output.
</p>
<p>
To to insert a unique script for every instance of the AdRotator we need to use a unique key. I use the server side controls ClientId property which will be difference for every instance of the control on any page. You could also use a GUID.

This is clearly the weakest post of all the posts about the AdRotator. I just kind of got this working an never really got very inspired to learn anything else about it. I posted it anyway as I felt I did need to cover this topic for completeness of the series. I&#39;ll try to update it soon.
