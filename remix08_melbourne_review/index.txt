Although this years Melbourne [REMIX][1] at the Town Hall was not the same
2-day extravaganza held at Crown Casino last year, it was still a very well
organised day with great content showcasing some of Australia's talent.

I've been getting into [Silverlight][2] a bit more since the beta 1 release
and like most other .NET developers have been pretty excited about the future
possibilities.  I had already consumed a lot of content from the [LasVegas
MIX][3] so wasn't really expecting too much other than to pick up some tips
&tricks and check out some cool demos, which there were plenty of.

The highlights for me ...

  * Keynote presentation in particular [Mark Pesce's presentation][4] on the
power of communication and how it is evolving through technology, and the
glimpse at ABC's silverlight based video content website.

  * [Jose Fajardo's][5] mini presentation on possibilities with Deep Zoom -
very inspiring.

  * all the single slide Deep Zoom presentations - in particular the ABC/Hydro
presentation - a much more interesting way to do a presentation rather than to
flick through some slides ... I'm expecting this to become much more common in
the future

  * learning about the new features provided in IIS7

  * getting a full copy of Expression Studio 2 :-)

  * and course, the networking drinks at the Longroom Bar.

Looking forward to next year already.
