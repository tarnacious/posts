Although this years Melbourne <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/australia/remix08/index.aspx">REMIX</a> at the Town Hall was not the same 2-day extravaganza held at Crown Casino last year, it was still a very well organised day with great content showcasing some of Australia&#39;s talent. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been getting into <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> a bit more since the beta 1 release and like most other .NET developers have been pretty excited about the future possibilities.&nbsp; I had already consumed a lot of content from the <a href="http://sessions.visitmix.com/">LasVegas MIX</a> so wasn&#39;t really expecting too much other than to pick up some tips &amp;tricks and check out some cool demos, which there were plenty of. 
</p>
<p>
The highlights for me ... 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Keynote presentation in particular <a href="http://blog.futurestreetconsulting.com/?p=55">Mark Pesce&#39;s presentation</a> on the power of communication and how it is evolving through technology, and the glimpse at ABC&#39;s silverlight based video content website. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.cynergysystems.com/blogs/page/josefajardo">Jose Fajardo&#39;s</a> mini presentation on possibilities with Deep Zoom - very inspiring.</li>
<li>all the single slide Deep Zoom presentations - in particular the ABC/Hydro presentation - a much more interesting way to do a presentation rather than to flick through some slides ... I&#39;m expecting this to become much more common in the future</li>
<li>learning about the new features provided in IIS7 </li>
<li>getting a full copy of Expression Studio 2 :-)</li>
<li>and course, the networking drinks at the Longroom Bar.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Looking forward to next year already.
