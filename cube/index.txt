WebGL has recently seen extra attention caused by banter between the major browser players, which seems to becoming pretty common.

Microsoft called it [harmful][harmful], a developer from Mozilla raised [an issue on Microsoft's connect showing the same risk in Silverlight 5][connect] and Opera and Google bloggers [weighed][opera] [in][google].

This week it seems to be more about [enterprise][enterprise].

I think WebGL is [awesome][awesome] and I am glad people are [pushing the boundaries][chrome] and although I'm not really into computer gaming, I would like see the graphic technology as part of the web medium.

To get a taste I just wanted to try doing something simple like a rotating cube.
Spoiled as we are there is a [MDN Getting Started with WebGL][gettingstarted] guide that walks through doing just that.

<div id="canvas-container">
<canvas id="canvas" width="640" height="480"></canvas>
</div>
<p id="notsupported" style="display:none">It appears your browser doesn't support WebGL.</p>

I roughly followed along writing in CoffeeScript and found a lot about what happens when you don't get it right.
There is quite a lot you need to do, correctly, just to draw a shape on screen programming directly against the API.

After some playing I had the cube you should see above, if the browser supports WebGl anyway.
Someone has written [IEWebGL plugin][iewebgl], but I haven't tried it. I posted the [source][source] here.
