*This is the presentation for [Composing Events with RxJS][1] an [Alt.Net Melbourne Lightning Talk][2].*

*** Reactive Extensions ***

* Reactive Extensions for JavaScript.
* There is also Reactive Extensions for C#.
* Reactive Extensions come from Microsoft Labs.

*** What is IEnumerable? ***

* Provides Enumerator, allows lazy evaluation
* You can implement an IEnumerable with yield and yield break.

*** What is Observable? ***

* When you foreach(..) through IEnumerable you are waiting OnNext.
* With Observable you are notified OnNext.

*** What is Rx ***

* Like Linq adds a generic common API to query, Rx attempts to add a common API to compose generic events.
* There are Select, Where, Join, Zip, Merge and many other constructs.
* Basically keeps track of events and callbacks.
* RxJs provides integration with several frameworks.
* Also provides common error handling, which I won't show.
