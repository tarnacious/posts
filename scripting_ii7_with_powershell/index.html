<p>I got a new computer at work and decided I would do all my local IIS configuration from a PowerShell console.
I've written scripts used to configure CI, staging and production enviroments so I just had to open Powershell instead of the IIS snap-in and go for it.</p>
<h2>WebDeply</h2>
<p>After getting my sites working created a gist as an example and on twitter recommended people should script their IIS configuration, 
I immediatly got a couple of tweets suggesting I use WebDeploy.</p>
<p>WebDeply from what I understand looks ok, it consists of a service running on your server boxes that can accept and deploy web packages sent its way.
I'm guessing you can build packages with some sort of visual tooling as is largely the Windows way. So why haven't I embraced it?</p>
<p>The Microsofts CI suite of tools are very tightly coupled and contains several I really dislike. TFS and MsTest come to mind immediatly, but there are others.</p>
<p>To use the alternate tools you have to learn how to fit them all together. You probably will have to learn a build system that is not encapsulted in a .sln or .proj file. You will probably have to write some scripts. It might be a little painful but the outcome is much more flexability, choice and opportunity in your CI process. </p>
<p>So I looked inside some of the generated packages and I looked at some of the scripts WebDeploy used. 
I didn't find it to my taste; in the package I traversed a deep directory tree before I could find my application and I found a scary batch script. 
It didn't feel right for human consumption and was worried I would have very little flexability outside the tooling provided.
I may well have it all wrong but I've been burnt before. Besides I like scripting.</p>
<h2>PowerShell</h2>
<p>I really thought PowerShell would become a core part of my development toolbelt. It just hasn't happened.<br />
</p>
<p>PowerShell tries to be two things; an advanced command prompt and a scripting language to sling .NET libraries. </p>
<p>As a command prompt, being able to pipe .net objects is pretty awesome, I just don't know who does it. 
Maybe there are some hardcore system admins who rock PowerShell? I don't know. </p>
<p>As a scripting language it appears only suitable for small adminstration script.
I also really dislike how it looks. 
Dollar signs for variables, curley braces, xsl like eq syntax; none of these I want in a scripting language. </p>
<p>I've played around extensively with IronPython with and .NET, I think it works well despite it often looks less pythonic and more like .NET. 
I think it or Ruby would be a much more preferable choice. At least by taking the time to learn Python/Ruby you can use it to build things. 
Powershell feels like one way, no through road to system administration.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about a @dagda1 tweet which makes sense, but isn't what I want to hear. </p>
<p>xxxxx</p>
<p>I think you could wrap all IIS administration in a sane .NET API with uses normal properties or discoverable API functions,
instead of guessing at Set-ItemProperty names and values. What is so special about PowerShell anyway?</p>
<p>You could then easily use any .NET language to mangage IIS. 
An IronPython script doing the task below may look similar but once you add error checking and it's requirements grew Python would surely be nicer to read.</p>
<h2>IIS Express</h2>
<p>I did briely think about last years announcement of IIS Express.</p>
<p>I haven't looked into IIS Express as I've always done web development on the Microsoft stack with a version of Windows that is capable of running IIS proper.
I hear it is functionally pretty much identical to IIS, but I really don't see any compelling reason for me to use it and introduce differences between my development environment and everywhere else my app is going to be deployed.</p>
