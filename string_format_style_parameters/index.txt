Just a reminder that the String.Format parameters aren't magic, we can make
methods with these parameters. Here is an example.


    public string StringFormat(string format, params object [] parameters)
    {
          return string.Format(format, parameters);
    }


I actually can't think of any great uses for it now, but I do use it to expose
string.Format style parameters on a LogMessage method in a custom logging
tool. This makes the code cleaner where I was using string.Format before
sending it to a LogMessage method as a string.

Next week, Named Parameters! (well probably not, but if I ever use them.. )
