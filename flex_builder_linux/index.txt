I read in a Linux magazine that Adobe were releasing Flex Builder for Linux. I
thought this was really exciting as it was a great chance to use [my new Linux
box][1] for some development and write a basic Flash application. It regularly
annoyed me that I had never developed a Flash application.

[Adobe Flex Builder Linux Public Alpha][2] is currently up to alpha 4. It is a
plug-in for Eclipse, a very popular, extendable development IDE build on Java.
I had to install Eclipse 3.3.2 because earlier version weren't working on my
machine and later version have problems with the plug in. I wanted to use
OpenJava but I couldn't get Eclipse working on it, so I decided it would just
be easier to use Sun Java.

Once I got Eclipse and Flex Builder working it was pretty fun. I was surprised
how much of the stuff I learned for Silverlight could be applied to Flex
Builder. In fact quite a few things I thought were unique to Silverlight were
already features in Flex Builder.

I found ActionScript was quite easy to get into, it looks similar to
JavaScript but with extra type information. The intellisense for ActionScript
with Eclipse and Flex Builder is really good and really helped.

Anyway here is my first Flash application!

<div id="demo_container"></div>

It was great from me to solve the mystery behind Flash files and find it is
just source code. In this application there are some ActionScript classes, the
main MXML and HTML/JavaScript to host it. Get the source code [here][3].

Well that was pretty fun but there is so much more. I'd like to write an
application that interacts with a server and try some of the cool data binding
Flex Builder supports.
