Long polling is a technique where the client makes a HTTP request to the server and server doesn't immediately complete the request.
The browser is left waiting for the request to complete. 
When the server wants to notify the client, it completes the request which raises an event the client can bind to.
This technique often uses iframes, I think mainly to hide hackery from the browser status bar.
