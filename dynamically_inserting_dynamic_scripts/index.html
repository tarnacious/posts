I came across this technique when I was trying to get around the cross-domain restrictions applied by modern browsers to the XMLHttpRequest object. Basically you can&#39;t do it.
</p>
<p>
This got me thinking, how does Google Maps do it? I have Google Map code in pages hosted on my domain. Somehow it&#39;s going to the Google server, from the browser, to get images. It can&#39;t be using XMLHttpRequest to do it, so how does it work?
</p>
<p>
Its seems ridiculously simple. You can reference scripts from another domain. You can use javascript to manipulate the DOM and web servers can deliver dynamic content based on a request. 
</p>
<p>
So all we have to do to dynamically request a dynamic script is run some javascript that will insert a script tag with the source attribute pointing to the desired URL in the document head tag. The browser will then request the script from that URL. The server can return a script based on the request parameters provided. When the browser receives the script it will add it to the DOM. 
</p>
<p>
My example here doesn&#39;t actually get the scripts off an external server or dynamically generate the script. The example has buttons that insert a script element into the head element when clicked. The script elements source attribute depends on which button is clicked, but both local script files display an alert message when loaded.&nbsp;

To see this example running, just open the folder as a Website in Visual Studios and run it. I&#39;ll add a link to a live demo soon. 
</p>
<p>
While this works really well, I will go into a light-weight Javascript framework I wrote that wraps round this concept and provides response, timeout and some error handling events as you would expect in most XMLHttpRequest wrappers.&nbsp;
