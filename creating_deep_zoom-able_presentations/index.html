Ever since I saw the Deep Zoom presentations at <a href="/post/2008/05/REMIX08-Melbourne-Review.aspx">Remix08 Melbourne</a> I was gob-smacked at how cool they were I wanted to give it a try.&nbsp; The smooth zooming and panning was incredible to watch and was much better than the boring old Powerpoint transitions.
</p>
<p>
So how do I do this ... well, as usual the first step was to Google for the solution and the best links I found about the topic were ... <a href="http://vaughanknight.com/blog/2008/05/making-a-deep-zoom-slide-deck.html">here </a>and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/canux/archive/2008/04/08/mini-tutorial-share-your-presentation-in-deep-zoom.aspx">here</a>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
They made it sound relatively straight forward but I struggled a little along the way.&nbsp; In particular I couldn&#39;t find an easy way to generate high resolution images from powerpoint, and the high resolution images are the key for a decent looking deep zoom experience as I found out.
</p>
<p>
Anyway&#39;s, here&#39;s what I did ...
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong> Use PowerPoint 2007 to create the presentation, which by the way has awesome image generation capabilities for roundpanels, arrows, smart art, etc.&nbsp; Even a humble developer such as myself can create pretty good looking slides that a hardened designer would take the time to glance at.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.</strong> Next, upgrade to latest <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=457b17b7-52bf-4bda-87a3-fa8a4673f8bf&amp;displaylang=en">deep zoom composer</a>, you&#39;ll probably also need to install some <a href="http://silverlight.net/GetStarted/">silverlight goodies</a> to get this going.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.</strong> Generate some high resolution images from PowerPoint.&nbsp; The higher the resolution the images the better experience you&#39;ll get out of DeepZoom.&nbsp; Powerpoint allows you to save each slide as an image which is great, simple and easy ... but I couldn&#39;t figure out how to maximize the resolution.&nbsp; There are a few settings you can tweak and apparently some registry hacks but nothing I tried seemed to work.&nbsp; When you view these images in your deepzoomed presentation they appear really blurred which is no good for anyone.
</p>
<p>
So I went down the track of saving the PowerPoint presentation as a pdf using the <a href="http://www.pdf995.com/">PDF995 print driver</a> which works great.
</p>
<p>
Now I just needed to produce&nbsp; high resolution images from the PDF ... which you can, but I couldn&#39;t find a tool that would do it for free without watermarking the images.
</p>
<p>
So out of pure frustration I just used the snapshot feature of the Acrobat reader, and pasted each slide image into <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.NET</a>, and saved that as a PNG. A little monotonous but it gave me much better resolution images than PowerPoint.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure there is an easier way than this, so if you find one then please let me know.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4.</strong> Then just use the deep zoom composer to setup you presentation and export it. This produces a couple of projects, Silverlight and Web Application, with a html page containing the silverlight deepzoom object. Open this up and as long as you have the Silverlight plugin installed then you away laughing. Well almost.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>Increase resolution for full screen browsing.</h2>
<p>
depending on your screen resolution you&#39;ll most likely want to increase the default resolution produced by the Deep Zoom Composer,&nbsp; otherwise the deep zoom appears in a bounded window within the browser, and I wanted a full screen experience when pressing the F11 key on IE7.
</p>
<p>
So you&#39;ll need to open up the solution file in Visual Studio which may mean installing Silverlight 2 beta 2 ... argh! More on that later.&nbsp; So if you manage to get that installed then ...
</p>
<p>
Modify the Page.xaml width and height of the UserControl ...
</p>
<p>
&lt;UserControl x:Class=&quot;DeepZoomProject.Page&quot;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xmlns=&quot;<a href='http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"'>http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation&quot;</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xmlns:x=&quot;<a href='http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"'>http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml&quot;</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Width=&quot;1280&quot; Height=&quot;1024&quot;&gt;</strong>
</p>
<p>
... and also the MultiScaleImage tag...
</p>
<p>
&lt;MultiScaleImage x:Name=&quot;msi&quot; <strong>MinHeight=&quot;480&quot; MinWidth=&quot;640&quot;</strong> Height=&quot;1024&quot; Width=&quot;1280&quot;/&gt;
</p>
<p>
 I also changed the width and height of the silverlight object in the html page of the Web Application project
</p>
<p>
object data=&quot;data:application/x-silverlight,&quot; type=&quot;application/x-silverlight-2-b2&quot; <strong>width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p>
... then rebuild the project.
</p>
<p>
Now when viewing in the IE browser hit F11 and yet again you&#39;re away laughing.&nbsp; Well, almost, really...
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>H<strong>osting a Silverlight site with IIS6</strong> </h2>
<p>
Since I wanted to access the DeepZoom presentation from other machines in the network I created a virtual directory in IIS6, pointed it to the DeepZoom Web project, but when I tried to browse the html file I experienced a javascript error.
</p>
<p>
The contents read something like ...
</p>
<p>
Unhandled Error in Silverlight 2 Application 
</p>
<p>
Code: 2014 
</p>
<p>
Category: Initialize Error&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Could not download the Silverlight application ... blah blah blah
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Apparently you need to do the following ...
</p>
<p>
1. Enable the content expiration setting to be one minute
</p>
<p>
2. Register some MIME typesand file extensions...
</p>
<p>
xap&nbsp; application/octet-stream
</p>
<p>
.xaml application/xaml+xml
</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
3. Change the execute permissions to &quot;Script Only&quot;
</p>
<p>
then presto ... all is good.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Solution I found was in ...

Thank-you kind sir.

<h3><strong>Fi</strong>xing Silverlight beta 1 to&nbsp; Silverlight beta 2 problems</h3>
<p>
 ... and there are plenty of <a href="http://silverlight.net/forums/">them</a>.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
In getting this to work I experienced some mild unpleasantness, almost approaching the absolute disgust I faced when trying out the alpha releases of silverlight which required a complete reinstall of my OS! .. there&#39;s a couple of days I&#39;ll never get back!
</p>
<p>
Anyway&#39;s, try here for starters ...
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bradleyb/archive/2008/06/18/fixing-setup-errors-installing-silverlight-tools-beta-2.aspx" title="http://weblogs.asp.net/bradleyb/archive/2008/06/18/fixing-setup-errors-installing-silverlight-tools-beta-2.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/bradleyb/archive/2008/06/18/fixing-setup-errors-installing-silverlight-tools-beta-2.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>
and read my contribution ... <a href="http://silverlight.net/forums/p/18765/64872.aspx#64872" title="http://silverlight.net/forums/p/18765/64872.aspx#64872">http://silverlight.net/forums/p/18765/64872.aspx#64872</a>, yep, not much.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Personally though, my installation is still a little stuffed, as I can&#39;t debug silverlight applications ...
</p>
<p>
so I&#39;ll probably end up reinstalling all VS and silverlight stuff :-( unless I find a solution in the next couple of days.
