<p>I still write heaps of little console applications to do all sorts of things. Most of the console applications I write are tools for tasks like deployment, manipulating data and processing images. Usually they are for my own use, if I find one really useful I might pass it on to the rest of our development team or publish it on this blog.&nbsp; </p> <p>For these little tools, I prefer using console applications over windows application as I feel they are more useful. Even though its easier to use a tool that has a little GUI, its not more useful if you ever want to automate it. </p> <p>Ideally I would prefer to write assemblies and use them from Powershell as it would provide the greatest usage flexibility. But it also requires competence scripting with Powershell. I was very excited about Windows Powershell when it was released, but a year on, I still haven't made it the integral part of my development toolset I thought it would be. This is an area I want to improve on, but this post is about command line arguments. </p> <p>Generally these little non production, internal applications are quite light weight and fit for purpose. I find I often write simple logging and command line processing that is also fit for purpose. This is fine, its usually very simple, quick to write and works. The problem is that I write this same functionality over and over again for each little application. </p> <p>I was toying with the idea of writing a generic command line parsing class. I figured I could use reflection on a settings class decorated with attributes describing the specific command line syntax. I figured I could even generate the help text using reflection too. While this seemed like a great idea, I am aware of time I've previously spent (wasted?) re-writing code where a perfectly good open source solution is available. </p> <p>So I did a search and found a couple of existing command line solutions. Not surprisingly, given they were both written in .NET 2.0+, they both used reflection and attributes. I ended up using the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/commandline">Command Line Parser Library</a> from CodePlex. I'm not sure if it does everything, but it does everything I need for 99% of the console applications I write that require command line processing.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>Anyway here is all the code from my test application:</p><pre class="csharpcode"><span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Options
{
    [Option(<span class="str">"r"</span>, <span class="str">"run"</span>, HelpText = <span class="str">"Run the export"</span>, Required = <span class="kwrd">true</span>)] 
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> Run;

    [Option(<span class="str">"n"</span>, <span class="str">"Name"</span>, HelpText = <span class="str">"Use a specific name"</span>)]
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Name = String.Empty;

    [HelpOption(HelpText = <span class="str">"Dispaly this help screen."</span>)]
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> GetUsage()
    {
        HelpText help = <span class="kwrd">new</span> HelpText(<span class="kwrd">new</span> HeadingInfo(<span class="str">"Hello World Example"</span>, <span class="str">"1.0.0"</span>));
        help.Copyright = <span class="kwrd">new</span> CopyrightInfo(<span class="str">"sharpthinking"</span>, 2008);
        help.AddPreOptionsLine(<span class="str">"Usage: Hello --run"</span>);
        help.AddOptions(<span class="kwrd">this</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> help;
    }
}</pre><pre class="csharpcode"><span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Options options = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Options();
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (Parser.ParseArguments(args, options, Console.Error))
        {
            <span class="kwrd">string</span> name = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.IsNullOrEmpty(options.Name) ? <span class="str">"World"</span> : options.Name;
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Hello {0}!"</span>, name);
        }
    }
}</pre>
<style type="text/css">.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
	font-size: small;
	color: black;
	font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
	background-color: #ffffff;
	/*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
	background-color: #f4f4f4;
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }
</style>
<p>And we get the expected usage from the command line</p>

<p>Now I have to make sure I bundle the console applications with an external assembly, but it does make using command line arguments easy.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
