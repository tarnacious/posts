sudo qemu-nbd --connect=/dev/nbd0 /path/to/image.qcow2

After this, existing disk partitions in the disk image will be mapped to /dev/nbd0p1, /dev/nbd0p2, /dev/nbd0p3, etc.

To check the list of nbd-mapped partitions, use fdisk:
$ sudo fdisk /dev/nbd0 -l

Finally, choose any one partition (e.g., /dev/nbd0p1) and mount it to a local mount point (e.g., /mnt).
$ sudo mount /dev/nbd0p1 /mnt

Now you will be able to access and modify the content of the disk image's mounted partition via /mnt mount point.

e2fsck /dev/vdb1
resize2fs 

Once you are done, unmount it, and disconnect the disk image as follows.
$ sudo umount /mnt
$ sudo qemu-nbd --disconnect /dev/nbd0
