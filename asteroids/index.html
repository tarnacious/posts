<p>Sorry no sounds, shields or extra weapons. 
There are already <a href="http://dougmcinnes.com/html-5-asteroids/">other</a> <a href="http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/asteroids/">good</a> asteroid games for the HTML5 canvas. 
I wrote this to try <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a>. 
I posted the <a href="https://gist.github.com/1022545">source as a gist</a>.</p>

<p>I have some ideas about how I could make it multiplayer I might consider trying,
of course <a href="http://www.lazeroids.com/">that has been done too</a>.</p>
