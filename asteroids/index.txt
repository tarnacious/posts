Update: You don't need coins, you can press [f] to start. Apparently I should have made that more clear.

there are already [other][mcinnes] [good][kev3d] asteroid games for the HTML5 canvas. 
I wrote this to try [CoffeeScript][coffeescript], which has been quite fun. 
I posted the [source as a gist][source].

I have some ideas about how I could make it multiplayer which I might consider trying,
of course [that has been done too][lazeroids].
