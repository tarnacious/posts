    "text": "Thanks mate, I see you have some pretty neat posts about doing similar things with and without frameworks.\r\n\r\nYes, reading the file asynchronously that would be better. Here is how it might look.   \r\n\r\n    [Get(\"/\")]\r\n    public void Home(IManosContext context)\r\n    {\r\n        var fs = new filestream(\"index.html\",filemode.open); \r\n        var data = new byte[fs.length];\r\n        fs.beginread(data, 0, (int)fs.length, (result) => { \r\n            var text = system.text.asciiencoding.ascii.getstring(data);\r\n            context.response.end(text);\r\n            fs.close();            \r\n        }, null);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nJust out of interest I tried load testing each implementation with ab, the Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool. I used 10000 request and a concurrency of 300.\r\n \r\n    $ ab -n 10000 -c 300 http://localhost:8080\r\n\r\nWith the blocking file read I got 6329 request / second and with the asynchronous code I got 7800 request / second. So yeah, good call :-)\r\n\r\nP.S. Apologies, my blog was adding and additional http:// in front of URL to you're site. The capital H in Http:// was throwing it. I've updated your URL so it links though right."
