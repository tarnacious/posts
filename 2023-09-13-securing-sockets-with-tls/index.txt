Using a [simple private Public Key Infrastructure][pki] (PKI), plain TCP
sockets can be secured with TLS. This can be demonstrated with trivial examples
that run locally on a loopback device.

A simple echo TCP socket server that listens on port 7000 can be created with
`socat`.

    #!/bin/bash
    $ socat PIPE TCP-LISTEN:7000,fork

When data is sent to the socket, it will echo it back. The `ncat` tool from
`nmap` is used because it has TLS features that will be needed later.

    #!/bin/bash
    $ echo "hello" | ncat localhost 7000
    hello

The socket listening on port 7000 won't actually be secured, sorry, instead a
new socket listening on port 6000 will provide a secure TLS tunnel/proxy.

The tunnel is created with `stunnel`. It's configured with local file called
[`stunnel.conf`][stunnel_conf] which contains a section for the tunnel.

    #!/bin/bash
    [service1]
    accept = 6000
    connect = 7000
    CAfile = ca.crt
    cert = service1.crt
    key = service1.key
    verify = 0

A tunnel called `service1` is configured that listens on port 6000 and creates
a tunnel to port 7000. The CA and `service1` certificates were created by the
PKI. The `verify` option is set to 0 meaning that peer (client) certificates
will not be required or verified.

The tunnel is started by running `stunnel` with the path to the configuration
file.

    #!/bin/bash
    $ stunnel service1.conf

Trying to connect port 6000 like before won't work.

    #!/bin/bash
    $ echo "hello" | ncat localhost 6000
    Ncat: Connection reset by peer.

The server is expecting the client to start a TLS negotiation. Instead, we're
sending the the characters "hello", so the server disconnects us. The error
[logged][not_ssl] by `stunnel` is "SSL routines::wrong version number" which
isn't particularly helpful.

Fortunately `ncat` supports TLS/SSL and it be used with the `--ssl` option.

    #!/bin/bash
    $ echo "hello" | ncat --ssl localhost 6000
    hello

A response is now returned through an encrypted TLS connection.

If this connection was made over an insecure network, there is no certainty
that the server being connected to is really `service1`. With TLS, certificates
used by 'service1' can be verified to have been signed by a specific CA and
belonging to service1.

To do this with `netcat` the `--ssl-verify` option tells `ncat` to check the
server certificate. The certificate should be signed by a specific CA, so
`ca.crt` needs to be specified with the `--ssl-trustfile` option. The name in
the certificate will also be validated, so `service1` needs to specified with
the `--ssl-servername` option.

    #!/bin/bash
    $ echo "hello" | ncat --ssl --ssl-verify --ssl-servername service1 --ssl-trustfile ca_public_key.pem  localhost 6000
    hello

Expecting a different server name should result in a certificate error.

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "hello" | ncat --ssl --ssl-verify --ssl-servername service2 --ssl-trustfile ca_public_key.pem  localhost 6000
    Ncat: Certificate verification error. QUITTING.

A really useful tool when debugging TLS connections is [`s_client`][s_client]
the `openssl` test client.

    #!/bin/bash
    openssl s_client -servername service1 -connect localhost:6000 -CAfile ca.crt

This will attempt to negotiate a connection and [output][s_client_log] a heaps
of useful information about the certificate, the signatures, the alorithms
used, the validation results and more.

TLS also supports a "peer authentication" mode in which the server checks the
client certificates. Servers, or tunnels, can be configured to only allow
clients with certificates signed by a specific CA to connect.

A secure tunnel configuration that uses strict peer authentication can be
added to the [`stunnel.conf`][stunnel_conf] file.

    #!/bin/bash
    [service1-secure]
    accept = 5000
    connect = 7000
    CAfile = ca.crt
    cert = service1.crt
    key = service1.key
    verify = 2

This tunnel is configuration is similar to the previous one except it'll listen
on a different port (5000) and `verify` is set to 2, meaning it will require
client certificates and will validate they are signed by the CA ([`ca.crt`][ca_crt])

If we restart the `stunnel` process with the updated configuration and try to
connect as before to port 5000, we get a different result.

    #!/bin/bash
    $ echo "hello" | ncat --ssl --ssl-verify --ssl-servername service1 --ssl-trustfile ca.crt  localhost 5000

This time we get no response, this is because we're not sending a certificate.
The error [logged][no_peer_certificate] by `stunnel` is "peer did not return a
certificate".

To connect to this service, a client certificate pair signed by the CA is
required. The process to generate a certificate pair for the client is the same
process used to create the `service1` certificate pair, but this certificate
pair will be called `client1`.

    #!/bin/bash
    SUBJECT="/C=DE/ST=Berlin/L=Berlin/O=tarnbarford.net/OU=tarnbarford.net/CN=client1"

    openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out client1.key
    openssl req -new -key client1.key -subj $SUBJECT -out client1.csr
    openssl x509 -req -days 365 -sha256 -in client1.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 1 -out client1.crt

The will generate a private key [`client1.key`][client1_key] and a public key
[`client1.crt`][client1_crt].

To configure `ncat` to use the client certificates,
[`client1.key`][client1_key] is provided with the  `--ssl-key` option and
[`client1.crt`][client1_crt] is provided with the `--ssl-cert` option.

    #!/bin/bash
    $ echo "hello" | ncat --ssl --ssl-verify --ssl-servername service1 --ssl-trustfile ca.crt --ssl-cert client1.crt --ssl-key client1.key  localhost 5000
    hello

A response is now returned, but only if the client and server certificates are
signed by the CA.
