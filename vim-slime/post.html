<h1>vim-slime</h1>

<p>Today I found the awesomeness that is <a href="https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime">vim-slime</a>. 
<a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">Slime</a> is the "The Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs", I can almost hear the emacs crowd laughing at me.</p>

<p>For those that use Vim and don't use slime or something similar, this is my understanding of what it's awesome. </p>

<p><strong>Text can be sent from any process to the stdin of a screen or <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a> session. 
The process in this case is Vim and the screen/tmux session is my terminal</strong>.</p>

<p>First some background on <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU Screen</a>. Screen is <a href="https://tarnbarford.net/journal/oh-screen-where-have-you-been">really neat</a> a terminal multiplexer (you can run multiple terminals. 
The multiplexed shell processes are child processes of the screen process, which is not a child of the terminal window. 
This means a screen process its child processes keep running if you close the terminal window.
You can re-connect to it later, this is what makes vim-slime possible.</p>

<p>Here is an screen shot of this in use. On the left is me in gvim writing some aweful Clojure [1]. 
On the right is a screen buffer in which I started a Clojure REPL. 
When I want to try run some code send any text selection to with REPL in a keystroke (but I'm using the default key binding of <crtl-c><crtl-c>).</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be a Clojure REPL either, you can send anything to a screen shell. 
You could run git commands, find, grep, sed. Like with the Clojure REPL we can even interact with any terminal programs that use STDIN.</p>

<p>This concept can be taken even further.
You can even connect to a tmux session over SSH and share a terminal or a <a href="http://remotepairprogramming.com/remote-pair-programming-with-tmux-and-vim-the">terminal program like vim to do remote pairing</a>!</p>

<p>Hopefully remote pairing is the topic of my next post as there are a couple remote programmers I know who are keen to do some pair hacking.
I stand to learn a lot!</p>

<p>[1]: I learnt almost everything I know about Lisp from <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/">The Little Schemer</a>. Great book.</p>
