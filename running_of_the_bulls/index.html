<p>I'm going to <a href="http://scoopcamp.de">Scoopcamp</a> for the <a href="http://scoopcamp.de/hackathon/">hackathon</a> again this
year as I had a lot of fun last year. I'm joining the Henri-Nannen-Schule team
who to want to make some news games.  To help ensure I can help with their
ideas and not get bogged down in boring technical details, I decided to have a
look at what tools, resources, libraries and frameworks exist these days that
might be useful.</p>

<p>This morning I decided I would build a game with the <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser HTML5 game
framework</a>, <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled map editor</a> and <a href="https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker">Texture Packer</a> (trail version) and post it on this blog. I decided the game
would be about bull fighting as I was trying to animate a bull earlier and
because I knew In√©s wouldn't approve.</p>

<p>I um, used, some peoples art. I hope this is ok, here is where I found it:</p>

<ul>
<li>The awesome Batman style collisions from <a href="https://dribbble.com/Morkki">Morkii</a> </li>
<li>I found the <a href="http://universomario.foros.ws/t1500/las-aventuras-de-toad/">Vega character spites in a forum</a> </li>
<li>The <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/orthographic-outdoor-tiles">map tiles</a> are by <a href="http://opengameart.org/users/buch">Buch</a></li>
<li>The background is from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser">Phaser Examples</a> project</li>
</ul>

<p>It's a bit of a mess, but was fun. I think I'm better prepared and now looking
forward to the hackathon.</p>
