I'm going to [Scoopcamp] [scoopcamp] for the [hackathon] [hackathon] again this
year as I had a lot of fun last year. I'm joining the Henri-Nannen-Schule team
who to want to make some news games.  To help ensure I can help with their
ideas and not get bogged down in boring technical details, I decided to have a
look at what tools, resources, libraries and frameworks exist these days that
might be useful.

This morning I decided I would build a game with the [Phaser HTML5 game
framework] [phaser], [Tiled map editor] [tiled] and [Texture Packer]
[texturepacker] (trail version) and post it on this blog. I decided the game
would be about bull fighting as I was trying to animate a bull earlier and
because I knew In√©s wouldn't approve.

I um, used, some peoples art. I hope this is ok, here is where I found it:

* The awesome Batman style collisions from [Morkii] [morkki] 
* I found the [Vega character spites in a forum] [vega] 
* The [map tiles][maptiles] are by [Buch][buch]
* The background is from the [Phaser Examples][phaserexamples] project

It's a bit of a mess, but was fun. I think I'm better prepared and now looking
forward to the hackathon.
