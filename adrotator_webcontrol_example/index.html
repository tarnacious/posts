I didn&#39;t really actually want to write another ad rotator, but I did think it would be a good example control to implement. It has the scope to cover some aspects of writing web controls I wanted to learn more about and discuss. I decided to build an ASP.Net web control that cycles through a list of images on the client side. There are a few areas I want to discuss. 
</p>
<p>
I wanted the control completely encapsulated within an assembly. So all you&#39;d need to use the control would be a copy of the assembly. To do this I embedded some resources in the assembly and read them out at runtime. I discuss this in the article.

</ul>
<p>
I wanted the control to be able to be created completely declaratively, and I thought providing the sort of intellisense you get when using standard ASP.Net controls would be nice.

</ul>
<p>
I wanted the server-side control to inject Javascript into the output. I wanted the control to be smart enough to only output the Javascript prototype, or class definition once, even if there were multiple controls on the page. I wanted the client side code to be as object orientated as possible.&nbsp;

You can download the source code which includes an example website in the solution.

I would like to add a post about supporting difference storage mechanisms and using the control, but I have other projects demanding my attention. Hopefully I&#39;ll get back to it sometime. 
</p>
<p>
I Hope you&#39;ve found some of these articles useful or interesting. I&#39;ll keep and eye on the comments, contribute to further discussion, and update the posts where errors or omissions are noted.
