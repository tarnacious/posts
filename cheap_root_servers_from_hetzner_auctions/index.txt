I rent a couple [Hetzner][hetzner] physical servers that run various services I
host. You can rent standard and custom configurations but these have an initial
setup cost and setup time. For impatient hobbyists like myself, Hetzner also
allows you to rent unused servers from their [server auctions][auction]. These servers
can be rented with a one month notice period, have no up front costs, and are
available to use almost immediately. 

I'm currently doing some experimenting we IPv6 bridge setups, for this I've
found a cheap server from the auctions and am trying to document the process.

When you order a physical server from [Hetzner][hetzner] you initially SSH into
a [rescue system][rescue], an environment where you can format, mount and
install an operating system on your servers disks. 

Note: when SSHing into the rescue system you may want to disable "strict host
checking" as the rescue system host key will be different than that of your
host.

    #!/bin/bash
    tarn@laptop $ ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no <your server address>

It's possible to mount the servers disks yourself and manually install whatever
you want. Hetzner also provides an `installimage` script that starts an ncurses
interface that leads you through the setup of various distributions and will
handle partitioning, grub, software RAID, root password, network configuration,
sshd and install your SSH key.   

    #!/bin/bash
    root@rescue ~ # installimage

I chose Debian 9 and took all the default options except the hostname, which I
changed to demo. This isn't very interesting, but I took some screen shots of
the process anyway. [1][1] [2][2] [3][3] [4][4] [5][5] [6][6] [7][7]

After installing the image you can reboot from the rescue system and your
server will boot up. 

    #!/bin/bash
    root@rescue ~ # reboot

The next time you SSH to your IP address you'll be connecting to your own
server. This time you want strict host checking so when we connect via SSH going
forward we can be confident we're connecting to our server.

    #!/bin/bash
    tarn@laptop $ ssh <your server address>
    root@demo ~ #

If all goes well you should have an ssh shell on your new physical server! 

If you ever find yourself in a situation where you can't SSH into your own
server because the network is misconfigured or the server doesn't boot, you can
re-enable the rescue system from the Hetzner web interface and either mount the
disks and fix the configuration or install a new operating system.

If you're having problems with the boot process you can also request VNC access
to the servers video device and input devices. This is a manual process that
requires raising a ticket, the few times I've make a request it's taken less
than half an hour to get setup.
