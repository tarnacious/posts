I have a headless server running [`libvirtd`][libvirt] with a
[`KVM`][kvm]/[`qemu`][qemu] backend and I wanted to securely connect to it with
[`virsh`][virsh] and [`virt-manager`][virt-manager] on my laptop. There are
[several ways to do this][libvirt_remote], I decided to try [TLS][tls] with a
[private PKI][private_pki] for transport encryption and peer authentication.

I wrote [a script][libvirt-ca] to generate a Certificate Authority (CA)
certificate, then generate certificates for the client and the server that are
both signed by the CA certificate. In my case the server name is
`hypervisor.tarnbarford.net`.

The server runnning libvirtd needs to be configured to support TLS connections.
On Debian systems the libvirtd configuration is in
[`/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf`][libvirtd_conf]. The relevant default
configuration values were good and I didn't make any changes to this file.

    #!/bin/bash
    listen_tls = 1
    tls_port = "16514"
    key_file = "/etc/pki/libvirt/private/serverkey.pem"
    cert_file = "/etc/pki/libvirt/servercert.pem"
    ca_file = "/etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem"
    tls_no_verify_certificate = 0

I needed to [copy the server certificates][copy_server_certificates] into the
locations specified in the configuration files.

On the server, I needed to [enable access to the port 16514][enable_port_16514]
through the filewall.

Debian has systemd unit for libvirt socket activation via the TLS port
[/lib/systemd/system/libvirtd-tls.socket][libvirtd-tls.socket]. This means
`libvirtd` will start when a connection to port 16514 is made.

For the client I needed to [copy my client certificates][copy_client_certificates] to the locations to [where libvirt expects them][libvirt_x509].

I'm now able to connect to my server with `virsh` on my laptop.

    #!/bin/bash
    $ virsh -c qemu+tls://hypervisor.tarnbarford.net:16514/system list
     Id   Name           State
    ------------------------------
     1    bacula         running
     2    loadbalancer   running
     3    mail-server    running
     4    tarnbarford    running
     5    monitoring     running
     7    bab-website    running
     8    owncloud       running
     9    icinga         running
     10   dns            running
     11   ns1            running

I can connect to the serial console of the virtual machines, which is pretty
useful when working with headless servers.

    #!/bin/bash
    $ virsh -c qemu+tls://hypervisor.tarnbarford.net:16514/system console tarnbarford
    Connected to domain 'tarnbarford'
    Escape character is ^] (Ctrl + ])

And I can connect `virt-manager` to work with `libvirtd` on my server.

What isn't yet working is using `virt-viewer` with [VNC][vnc] or [SPICE][spice]
to conect to the displays of the virtual machines.

The VNC and SPICE connections are directly from virtual
machine emulators, not via `libvirtd` so this needs to be setup separately. I'd
really like to get this working smoothly, so I expect to post something about
this soon.
