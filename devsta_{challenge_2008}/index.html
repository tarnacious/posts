<p>200 hours and 8 minutes later, my devsta entry is finally complete and submitted! Over the next week or so I'll write a post about writing it, how it turned out, what I learned and hopefully provide the code for download. For now, here is a brief description and some screen shots from in the game. </p> <p><strong><em>"Micro Machines was one of my favourite old school games and I thought it would be cool to race a Micro Machine around a fictional devsta’s desktop. Who wouldn’t want to race around those icons and windows, trashing the desktop with tire marks? <br /></em></strong><strong></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Desktop Racer is a Silverlight 2 game. It has a Micro Machine like zoomed in mode, and also a mode where the whole desktop is visible. Players can play 1 or 3 laps time trails."</em></strong> </p> <p><a href="http://static.sharpthinking.com.au/devsta2008.tarn.desktopracer.screenshot0.png"><img alt="" src="devsta2008.tarn.desktopracer.screenshot0.small.png" /></a> </p> <p>The game starts with an intro and some jokes in a command window </p> <p>&nbsp; </p> <p><a href="http://static.sharpthinking.com.au/devsta2008.tarn.desktopracer.screenshot2.png"><img alt="" src="devsta2008.tarn.desktopracer.screenshot2.small.png" /></a> </p> <p>I used a cruise control window for the start lights </p><a href="http://static.sharpthinking.com.au/devsta2008.tarn.desktopracer.screenshot3.png"><img alt="" src="devsta2008.tarn.desktopracer.screenshot3.small.png" /></a> <p>You can watch the devsta video while playing! </p><a href="http://static.sharpthinking.com.au/devsta2008.tarn.desktopracer.screenshot1.png"><img alt="" src="devsta2008.tarn.desktopracer.screenshot1.small.png" /></a> <p>&nbsp; </p> <p>Finally a trashed desktop and the finish flag toaster. </p>
