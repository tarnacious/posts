200 hours and 8 minutes later, my [devsta][4] entry is finally complete and
submitted! Over the next week or so I'll write a post about writing it, how it
turned out, what I learned and hopefully provide the code for download. For
now, here is a brief description and some screen shots from in the game.

**_"Micro Machines was one of my favourite old school games and I thought it
would be cool to race a Micro Machine around a fictional devstas desktop. Who
wouldnt want to race around those icons and windows, trashing the desktop with
tire marks?_**

**_Desktop Racer is a Silverlight 2 game. It has a Micro Machine like zoomed
in mode, and also a mode where the whole desktop is visible. Players can play
1 or 3 laps time trails."_**
