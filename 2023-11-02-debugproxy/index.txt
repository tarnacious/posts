debugProxy was a project I worked on with [David][david] in 2017, I hosted and
supported the service at [debugproxy.com][debugproxy.com] for several years. I
did a "Show HN" [thread][hackernews] when we released it which was on the front
page for a few hours, this gave us plenty of initial users. Despite it working
quite well once setup, configuring devices to use it and trust root
certificates was always fiddly and very difficult if a certificate pinning
technique was used. I made all the [code][github] public in 2019. By 2021 usage
was sporadic and I shut it down.

Despite the project not being wildly successful, I enjoyed working on it and am
proud of what we built.

Because I've apparently learned nothing, I decided to see if it would still
work. It turns out I can't even install the packages to build the frontend code
anymore (React 15.6, Webpack 4), but I could find a copy of the compiled
JavaScript, which I've [added][frontend] to the repository. To run the backend
code, I had to [build][python] Python 3.7 and [pin][versions] a few dependency
versions.

I regret to say that I have DebugProxy fully working at
[debugproxy.tarnbarford.net][debugproxy]. I'm definitely not going to provide
support for getting specific devices to use the proxy, but if there are issues
with the proxy or the website, I'd be interested to hear about it.
