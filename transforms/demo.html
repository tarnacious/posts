    <h1>Transforms</h1>
    <p>I've been playing with the transforms on canvas and have had to brush up how transforms work.
    It's really just matrices math; eigenvalues, dot products, triple products etc.
    I <em>should</em> know this stuff pretty well as it was extensively covered in my Engineering undergrad studies and
    I've previously played with them to do 2d and 3d computer graphics.</p>
    <p>When I have choice between understanding the math and just typing a few lines few lines and seeing
    the effect, I often just do the latter. I know, I really need to get past that.</p>
    <p>I seemed to be able to get transforms to do what I <em>wanted</em> them to do, but until I got them right
    I was finding they often didn't do what I expected they would.</p>
    <p>So I decided I would explore it a bit using the transforms themselves, but I'm not sure if I've cleared up my understand.
    I probably should have just studied the math and written an asteroids game.</p>
    <h2>Rotate on axis then centre</h2>
    <p>The example transform I looked at was rotating an square drawn from (0,0) to (50,50) about its centre, then
    moving it to (50,50).</p>
    <p>This is basically a series of transforms, where the order is important. If this makes perfect sense you can
    probably just check out the animations and hopefully leave a comment explaining what is going on more clearly than I have.</p>
    <pre>
        translate(50,50)
        rotate(Math.PI/4)
        translate(-25,-25)
        draw(..)
    </pre>
    <p>My brain thought this looked a bit backward, and it wasn't helped when I tried to animate applying the transforms one by one.
    Sure it worked out, but not as I expected it too.</p>
    <canvas id="demo1" height="300" width="300">
        <strong>Yo, this demo requires canvas. Best viewed with a browser that supports it.</strong>
    </canvas>
    <p><a id="demo1_start" href="#">Click to start animation</a></p>
    <p>I noticed this would look as I expected if I animated the transforms in reverse order while still applying them in the correct order. </p>
    <canvas id="demo2" height="300" width="300">
        <strong>Yo, this demo requires canvas. Best viewed with a browser that supports it.</strong>
    </canvas>
    <p><a id="demo2_start" href="#">Click to start animation</a></p>
    <p>The previous animations illustrate what was bothering me, but they are not exactly what I wanted to show in the first place.
       The transforms apply to the canvas and the square is drawn at (0,0) after the transforms are applied.
       </p>
    <p>To show that we need to invert everything and more the axises instead.</p>
    <canvas id="demo3" height="300" width="300">
        <strong>Yo, this demo requires canvas. Best viewed with a browser that supports it.</strong>
    </canvas>
    <p><a id="demo3_start" href="#">Click to start animation</a></p>
    <p>You would think be now I would have started to understand all this but I haven't really.
    What is more annoying is I wanted make a demo a user could add arbitrary transforms one at time,
    but the only way I could animate that nicely is if I asked for the transforms in reverse order.
    Perhaps that is the way to think about it.
    </p>

    <p>Anyway I suck, hopefully a commenter can explain this more clearly than I have. Until then I hope this helps you grok how transforms work, but the real lesson here is know ye' math. Stay at school kids.</p>
