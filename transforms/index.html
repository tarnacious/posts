<p>I've been playing with the transforms on canvas and have had to brush up how transforms work.
It's really just matrices math; eigenvalues, dot products, triple products etc. 
I <em>should</em> know this stuff pretty well as it was extensively covered in my Engineering undergrad studies and
I've previously played with them to do 2d and 3d computer graphics.</p>

<p>When I have choice between understanding the math and just typing a few lines few lines and seeing <br />
the effect, I often just do the latter. I know, I really need to get past that.</p>

<p>I seemed to be able to get transforms to do what I <em>wanted</em> them to do, but until I got them right
I was finding they often didn't do what I expected they would.</p>

<p>So I decided I would explore it a bit using the transforms themselves, but I'm not sure if I've cleared up my understand.
I probably should have just studied the math and written an asteroids game.</p>

<h2>Rotate on axis then centre </h2>

<p>The example transform I looked at was rotating an square drawn from (0,0) to (50,50) about its centre, then 
moving it to (50,50).</p>

<p>This is basically a series of transforms, where the order is important. If this makes perfect sense you can
probably just check out the animations and hopefully leave a comment explaining what is going on more clearly than I have.</p>

<pre><code>translate(50,50)
rotate(Math.PI/4)
translate(-25,-25)
draw(..)
</code></pre>

<p>My brain thought this looked a bit backward, and it wasn't helped when I tried to animate applying the transforms one by one.
Sure it worked out, but not as I expected it too.</p>

<p>I noticed this would look as I expected if I animated the transforms in reverse order while still applying them in the correct order.</p>

<p>The previous animations illustrate what was bothering me, but they are not exactly what I wanted to show in the first place. 
The transforms apply to the canvas and the square is drawn at (0,0) after the transforms are applied.</p>

<p>To show that we need to invert everything and more the axises instead.</p>

<p>You would think be now I would have started to understand all this but I haven't really.
What is more annoying is I wanted make a demo a user could add arbitrary transforms one at time,
but the only way I could animate that nicely is if I asked for the transforms in reverse order.
Perhaps that is the way to think about it.</p>

<p>Anyway I suck, hopefully a commenter can explain this more clearly than I have. Until then I hope this helps you grok how transforms work, but the real lesson here is know ye' math. Stay at school kids.</p>
