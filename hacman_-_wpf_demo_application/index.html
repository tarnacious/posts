HacMan is a game Brodie and I wrote to have a bit of fun trying out WPF. The game is in classic PacMan style, but our colleague S Haxby is the HacMan. His task is to fix bugs and avoid being eaten by the managers. Its far from polished code, or a complete game but I thought I&#39;d post it anyway as its a pretty cool WPF demo.&nbsp;

We tried to write the game engine decoupled from the presentation so we could also implement the presentation in DirectX or Silverlight if we wanted.

There is probably a reference to an NUnit assembly which I haven&#39;t included in project. You may need to download the latest NUnit assemblies and update the reference. Other than that its a fairly standard VS2008 project.
