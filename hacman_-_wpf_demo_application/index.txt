HacMan is a game Brodie and I wrote to have a bit of fun trying out WPF. The
game is in classic PacMan style, but our colleague S Haxby is the HacMan. His
task is to fix bugs and avoid being eaten by the managers. Its far from
polished code, or a complete game but I thought I'd post it anyway as its a
pretty cool WPF demo.

We tried to write the game engine decoupled from the presentation so we could
also implement the presentation in DirectX or Silverlight if we wanted.

There is probably a reference to an NUnit assembly which I haven't included in
project. You may need to download the latest NUnit assemblies and update the
reference. Other than that its a fairly standard VS2008 project.
