This article is part of a series of posts about various aspects of writing web
controls for ASP.Net using an ad rotator as an example. The [AdRotator
WebControl Example][1] post has links to related posts and downloads.

The AdRotator has several scripts which it emits in the output. I wanted the
AdRotator completely encapsulated in a single "dll" file. I choose to embed
the scripts in the assembly and read them back at run time. I could have
included the scripts in the code as a string but I feel having escaped script
declarations in code is more difficult to read and maintain. It also makes it
difficult for the IDE to provide intellisense.

Its easy to embed a file included in a project into the projects output
assembly. The setting can be found by selecting properties of the file you
want embed and selecting "Embedded Resource" as the "Build Action".

[embed_resource_example][1]

The file can be read back as a stream by reflecting the assembly and getting
the resource by name. Below is an example of reading a resource by name into a
string.

    private string GetResourceString(string resourceName)
    {
        Assembly assembly = GetType().Assembly;
        string resourceFullName = string.Format("{0}.{1}", assembly.GetName().Name, resourceName);
        string resourceString;

        using (Stream stream = assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(resourceFullName))
        {
            TextReader reader = new StreamReader(stream);
            resourceString = reader.ReadToEnd();
            reader.Close();
        }

        return resourceString;
    }


As far as the code above goes, if it was a more professional application the
method would be protected by a unit tested wrapper with application specific
exception handling.

There is a [free tool][4] created by the Sells Brothers you can use to view
the resources embedded in an assembly that may be useful.
